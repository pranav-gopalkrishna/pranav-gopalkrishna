# Hello there, fellow human
I am Pranav Gopalkrishna, an avid programmer, reader and writer, having done a number of projects (research-based and/or application-based) and writings, which range from fiction to poetry to technical essays. Apart from this, I have also composed music (and may do so again in the future), and I occasionally post videos (videos about anything I like, touching areas such as music, Minecraft timelapses, project presentations and essays read aloud). You may be wondering my GitHub site is so empty. Well, that's because this is only a portal, a gateway to my true profile, [@pranigopu](https://github.com/pranigopu). Here are my main links:
